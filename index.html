		   “Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live” and “A code is like love, it has created with clear intentions at the beginning, but it can get complicated.” and "Not only is programming vital to success in the technology-driven economy of the 21st century, but it can teach kids a broad range of skills that will help them in countless other areas as well. Here are six quotes from an assortment of science and technology luminaries who know exactly how important coding is to future success." - Jonny Depp.
